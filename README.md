# Aero-Design-1

The purpose of this project was to design a mission to  fly  a  tank  filled  with liquid nitrogen (LN2) on the Aft-Bulkhead Carrier (ABC) of a Centaur upperstage. This  tank  would  then  be  sent through a  series of maneuvers to induce liquid slosh in the tank and record the results in order to send the data back to Earth.

Thermal analysis was conducted to ensure that insulation of the LN2 tank was sufficient enough to sustain the LN2 at cryogenic temperatures throughout the duration of the mission.
