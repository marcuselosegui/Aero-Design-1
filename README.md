# Aero-Design-1

The purpose of this project was to design a mission to  fly  a  tank  filled  with liquid nitrogen (LN2) on the Aft-Bulkhead Carrier (ABC) of a Centaur upperstage. This  tank  would  then  be  sent through a  series of maneuvers to induce liquid slosh in the tank and record the results in order to send the data back to Earth. The final design was modeled in SolidWorks and rendered below.

Thermal analysis was conducted to ensure that insulation of the LN2 tank was sufficient enough to sustain the LN2 at cryogenic temperatures throughout the duration of the mission. The payload was treated as a composite radial system with gaps in between the beta cloth and vacuum jacket, as well as between the vacuum jacket and the tank. The necessary assumptions made were one-dimensional heat transfer and steady state.
